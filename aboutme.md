For work, I am an IT automation engineer, specializing in Ansible and Python to automate storage arrays. I just began
working as an automation engineer in 2023. Prior to that I was a mechanical engineer working in research and
development departments for various companies/industries. I have around 15 patents to my name. While I was successful
in the field of mechanical engineer, I was just more passionate about programming. Even as a mechanical engineer, I
took on responsibilities like CAD/PDM administration, and writing scripts to automate related tasks.

Outside of work, I have a passion for using and contributing to open source software. My favorite home lab project
is [Plex](https://plex.tv). While it is not open source, it has been the single biggest motivator for me to learn
programming. Initially, by writing scripts to automate various tasks related to Plex, and then by developing
plugins and tools for Plex. I've been using Plex since 2013 or so, and with that said I've been a bit disappointed with
the direction the project has taken in recent years. Due to that I've been getting started with developing plugins for
[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org), although I have not personally used it outside of development, yet.

I also enjoy playing video games. I've mostly been a console gamer throughout my life, while still enjoying the
occasional PC game. I got started playing video games on the NES. Since the original Xbox was released, I've been
gaming exclusively on Xbox consoles. I still own an original Xbox, an Xbox 360 Elite, and Xbox One X. Each of these
has also been modified in one way or another. While I've enjoyed gaming a lot over the years, I've not played that
much since I started my programming journey. I'm hoping to get back into it more in the future, and possibly
combine the two by developing a video game.

Most of my open source projects, are related to gaming and/or Plex. They are mostly under the
[LizardByte](https://github.com/LizardByte) organization on GitHub. If you're interested in learning more about
our projects, check out the GitHub organization page above or our
