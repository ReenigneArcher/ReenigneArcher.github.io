This is my first blog post. I've decided to start a blog to document my development journey, and to share my
experiences and lessons learned with others. I hope that you find it useful, and maybe even learn something!

You may recognize me from my involvement with [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine), a self-hosted
game streaming service. I've been maintaining that project for just shy of 2 years now, and it's been a fantastic
learning experience. When I started maintaining the project, I knew very little about dev-ops, and even less about
C++. Honestly, I had no business trying to maintain Sunshine, but the success of Sunshine was important for another
project of mine to succeed. My C++ contributions to Sunshine have been rather minimal; however, I have contributed to
the project greatly with CI/CD. I believe CI automation is one of the most critical aspects of a project. I'm hoping
to share some of these lessons learned in future blog posts.

If you're interested in any specific topics, feel free to reach out to me on any of the socials, or leave a comment.
